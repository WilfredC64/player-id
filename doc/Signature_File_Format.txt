SIGNATURE FILE FORMAT V2.0


CHANGE LOG
==========
V1.0: initial release
V2.0: added support for && token and made END token optional


SPECIFICATION
=============

Signatures are stored in a config file, e.g., in a file named "sidid.cfg".
This file should be ISO-8859-1 encoded.

A signature starts with a name that can be a player/editor name or if that is
not known, it is common to put the author's name of the player/tunes for a
signature name. A signature name must not contain spaces and should be at
least 3 characters long.

A signature consists of 2 hexadecimal digits and can contain wildcards by
specifying a ?? token. A wildcard for a nibble is not possible. Each value
and wildcard is separated by a space.

A signature can also contain multiple groups of bytes by using an AND token.
The AND token can also be written like && (introduced in version 2 of the file
format). With this token you can skip multiple bytes until the next occurrence
is found.

Each signature can be ended with the END token. This is useful when you want
to define a signature on multiple lines. If no END token is used, a signature
definition ends at the end of the line. For version 1 of the file format the
END token is required at the end of each signature.

Signatures can be separated by an empty line or can be put together. A new
signature starts when the line specifies a signature name.

Example:

Anthony_Lees
BD ?? ?? 18 ?? ?? ?? 99 00 D4 A9 00 7D ?? ?? 99 01 D4

Example with AND/&& token:

Paul_Norman/Cosmi
C8 D0 02 E6 ?? B1 && 8D 00 D4 && C8 D0 02 E6 ?? B1 && 8D 08 D4

Sometimes it is not possible to have only one signature for a player. You can
therefore specify multiple signatures for the same player, like:

Mark_Cooksey
8E ?? ?? B1 ?? F0 ?? E8
C8 B1 FB 9D ?? ?? C8 98 18 65 FB 9D ?? ?? A5 FC 69 00 9D

If one of the two or both IDs are detected, the signature Mark_Cooksey will be
reported.

You can also specify sub signatures when e.g. a certain player is covered by a
signature, and you want to cover a certain version of it or additional routine
with another signature.
The convention for specifying sub signatures is to put the player name between
brackets, like:

(Rob_Hubbard_Digi)
4A 4A 4A 4A 4C ?? ?? 29 0F EE ?? ?? D0 03 EE ?? ?? 8D 18 D4 AD 0D DD

(DUSAT/RockMon2)
48 29 0F AA CA 68 4A 4A 4A 4A 18 69 ?? 8D ?? ?? 4C

If you want to specify a signature on multiple lines:

Georg_Brandt
85 ?? A2 ?? A9 ?? 9D 00 D4 A9 FF 9D ?? ?? CA
10 F3 AD ?? ?? 8D ?? ?? 8D ?? ?? A9 ?? 8D 18 D4 END
C8 B1 ?? 9D ?? ?? BD ?? ?? 09 01 9D 04 D4 88

Note that the first two lines are seen as one signature because of the END token
missing at line 1 and because it is present at line 2. If the END token was not
mentioned at line 2, then line 1 and 2 are seen as separate signatures.


HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN SIGNATURES
=================================

When you make your own signature, you should not specify addresses in the
signature since players are most of the time relocated at any address. However,
addresses that reference I/O are a good thing to have in the signature.

For example, you have the following code that you want to make a signature for:

;0F2E  AA        TAX
;0F2F  BD 0B 10  LDA $100B,X
;0F32  99 01 D4  STA $D401,Y
;0F35  A6 FF     LDX $FF
;0F37  AC AD 01  LDY $01AD
;0F3A  BD D0 01  LDA $01D0,X
;0F3D  99 04 D4  STA $D404,Y
;0F40  CA        DEX
;0F41  30 03     BMI $0F46
;0F43  4C 30 0A  JMP $0A30
;0F46  60        RTS

The signature for this would be:

AA BD ?? ?? 99 01 D4 A6 ?? AC ?? ?? BD ?? ?? 99 04 D4 CA 30 ?? 4C ?? ?? 60

As you can see, addresses and zero-page references are replaced by a wild card,
except for SID address references. Also, the second byte of BMI is left out but
this is not a requirement. It's useful when the branch is not always pointing
to the same location.

Make sure you only specify code in your signature and not data.

To find a good signature for a player, try to get at least two tunes that you
expect that are using the same player.

Then disassemble the SID or PRG file with a 6502 disassembler or with machine
code monitor that can do this.

Try to see if there are similarities, make multiple signatures and run them
with player-id to see if they match for both files and also for other SID files.

If you see code that does match mostly but not fully, try to see if you can hide
the code that doesn't match with wildcards or, if it is not possible to solve
with wildcards, and you can't find a better signature, make use of the AND token
to skip multiple bytes.

It is not recommended to make very large signatures. The more specific a
signature is, the less it will eventually match, and it might be that it will
not match future SID files that have a slightly modified player code.

The same counts for very small signatures, try not to make very small
signatures to avoid false positive matches unless the code is very specific
and if it is not possible to cover all the SID files with a bigger signature.


INFO FILE FORMAT
================

Each config file can have an info file, e.g. a file named "sidid.nfo". An info
file contains information about a signature. The info filename is the same as
the config filename but with extension nfo. The info file should be ISO-8859-1
encoded.

An info section starts with the signature name. This name should be present in
the config file and must have the same casing. The lines under the signature
name can have the following tags:

* NAME
* AUTHOR
* RELEASED
* REFERENCE
* COMMENT

The tags should be present in the same order but are all optional and at least
one of the tags should be present for a signature. The tag is followed by a
colon and a space. All the colons should be aligned, see example below.

NAME
  The full name of the player or editor.

AUTHOR
  The author(s) of the player or editor.

RELEASED
  Includes the first release year of the player/editor, if known, and it may
  be followed with the publisher, group or author that released it.

REFERENCE
  This is a URL of the release of the player or editor. It can only have one
  URL. If more references are known, it is common to put the reference of the
  first known release.

COMMENT
  Includes extra information about the player/editor. This tag can contain
  multiple lines. The lines should be aligned and padded with spaces.

Example of an info section:

Music_Construction_Set
     NAME: Will Harvey's Music Construction Set
   AUTHOR: Will Harvey
 RELEASED: 1984 Electronic Arts
REFERENCE: https://csdb.dk/release/?id=185248
  COMMENT: Originally developed for the Apple II and ported to other systems
           like the C64

Info sections can be separated by an empty line or can be put together. A new
section starts when the line specifies a signature name.
