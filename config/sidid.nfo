OxyMod/THCM
   AUTHOR: Uwe Anfang (The Human Code Machine)
  COMMENT: The technique used in this player was discovered by Otto Järvinen
           (SounDemoN) in 2006. It makes use of waveform $00 in combination
           with the test bit and uses the frequency register to write the 8-bit
           sample data to the SID chip.
           More info about this technique:
           https://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:vicious_sid_demo_routine_explained
           The same technique was already discovered in 1993 and used in the
           DigiMaster utility by Chris Brenner.

   AUTHOR: Pex Tufvesson (Mahoney)
  COMMENT: The player uses a technique to play 8-bit samples at 44.1kHz via the

  COMMENT: "Q: How did you get involved with using sampled sounds?
           MG: I figured out how samples were played by hacking into someone
           else's code... OK, I admit it... It was a drum synthesizer package
           called Digidrums, actually, so you could still say I was the first to
           include samples in a piece of music. [...] Never would I claim to have
           invented that technique, I just got it published first. In fact, I
           couldn't really figure out where they got the sample data, just that
           they were wiggling the volume register, so I tried to make up my own
           drum sample sounds in realtime - which is the flatulence stuff that
           shipped in 'Arkanoid'. [...] After the project was in the shops I
           gained access to some real drum samples, and I slid those into my own
           custom version of the tune. The one that's in the shops is kind of a
           collage of farts & burps, don't you think? [...] Later I was able to
           acquire some proper drum samples and by 'Game Over' it got quite
           sophisticated." (MG)
